/*Think about your favorite apps, and pick one that stores your data- like a game that stores scores, an app that lets you post updates, etc. Now in this project, you're going to imagine that the app stores your data in a SQL database (which is pretty likely!), and write SQL statements that might look like their own SQL.

CREATE a table to store the data.
INSERT a few example rows in the table.
Use an UPDATE to emulate what happens when you edit data in the app.
Use a DELETE to emulate what happens when you delete data in the app.*/

/* What does the app's SQL look like? */

/*Start Create Table*/

CREATE TABLE impulse
    (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    name TEXT,
    game TEXT,
    level INTEGER,
    minutes INTEGER);

INSERT INTO impulse (name, game, level, minutes) VALUES ("mattie", "draw one line", "20", "45");
INSERT INTO impulse (name, game, level, minutes) VALUES ("mattie", "candy sort", "55", "72");
INSERT INTO impulse (name, game, level, minutes) VALUES ("mattie", "robotic flows", "19", "30");

/*Check Work*/
SELECT * FROM impulse;

/*End Create Table*/



/* Update Emulator*/

UPDATE impulse SET level = "25" WHERE id = 1;
UPDATE impulse SET minutes = "52" WHERE id = 1;
UPDATE impulse SET level = "57" WHERE id = 2;
UPDATE impulse SET minutes = "80" WHERE id = 2;
UPDATE impulse SET level = "24" WHERE id = 3;
UPDATE impulse SET minutes = "38" WHERE id = 3;

/*Check Work*/
SELECT * FROM impulse;

/*END Update Emulator*/

/*START Deletion Emulator*/

DELETE FROM impulse WHERE level < 25;

/*Check Work*/
